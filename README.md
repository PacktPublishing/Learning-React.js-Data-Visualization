## About the Video Course
React is an incredibly popular part of modern full stack web development, and is a keystone of fluid SPAs (single page applications). It is capable of rendering data reactively onto the web, enabling users to interact with it and see the results in real time. Using JSON as the data format, this course will show you how to ingest your data and display it on the web using a variety of techniques, such as charts and grids. It will run through the logic process, meaning that you will be able to take these skills and apply them in your own projects. Along the way, you will also learn more about the new ES6 language and how it can benefit your React skills, and how to create React controllers.Beginning with gaining an understanding of JSON and how to create JSON files, then how to load them using webpack and ES6 and integrate them into a React component. We will then examine different data types, and how to move data between them in order to create a reactive map. Next, we will use ChartJS to display data in various chart forms, and finally we will look at how to load data dynamically from a MongoDB database and display it in our React component.
